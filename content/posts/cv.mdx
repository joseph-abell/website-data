## Contact

Joseph Abell - jobs@josephabell.co.uk

## Profile

I have seven years of website development experience, using a healthy mix of Javascript and
CSS. I use React and Redux to build progressive web apps, and use GraphQL and PostgreSQL to make APIs. I have enjoyed working with Vue and Vuex in personal projects, and I have had experience using Angular 1.5, Backbone and Knockout.

I attempt to keep pushing my knowledge about the industry, and I regularly give talks at Piksel and local development meetups to spread the knowledge. My most recent talk was exploring how to generate a GraphQL endpoint by using a Postgres schema. Previously I have talked about how to successfully practice Test Driven Development, using Functional Programming techniques in JS, creating Progressive Web Apps, and how to pair program.

## Professional Experience

### Senior Javascript Developer at Piksel

York. March 2015 – present.

My current role is to develop a CMS for Video on Demand platforms. This is in latest React, but
started as an Angular 1.5 app, which I helped rewrite. I am the main contributer to the open
sourced SDK, which smooths over the inconsistencies of the APIs we create, giving clients a better development experience when integrating with our services.

Previously at Piksel I was a part of a team that developed a white-label VOD service to sell as
a product. I created responsive websites, Android, iOS, and various television apps. I worked
on the Backbone frontend, and used Cordova to help porting with platforms. I started working on reskinnning the apps for clients, but quickly moved to the core development team, working on both the backbone app and creating a React replacement.
