## Professional Experience

### Fullstack Developer at Isotoma

February 2020 - present.

My current role is as a fullstack developer working on complex applications using React and AWS.

### Javascript Developer at Netsells

York. September 2019 - January 2020

I helped develop webapps written in VueJS, using PHP as a backend. It didn't take long for me to realise
that I prefered not doing this.

### Javascript Developer at Piksel

York. March 2015 – September 2019.

I developed CMS for Video on Demand platforms. This is in latest React, but
started as an Angular 1.5 app, which I helped rewrite. I am the main contributer to the open
sourced SDK, which smooths over the inconsistencies of the APIs we create, giving clients a better development experience when integrating with our services.

Previously at Piksel I was a part of a team that developed a white-label VOD service to sell as
a product. I created responsive websites, Android, iOS, and various television apps. I worked
on the Backbone frontend, and used Cordova to help porting with platforms. I started working on reskinnning the apps for clients, but quickly moved to the core development team, working on both the backbone app and creating a React replacement.
